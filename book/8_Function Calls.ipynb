    "\n",
    "As your programs start becoming larger and more complex, you will find yourself in situations where you need the same functionality in different places of your code. \n",
    "A simple and straightforward way of doing this is by copying code you have written before and pasting it at the desired location in your program. \n",
    "However, this alternative is not effective nor maintainable in the longer run:\n",
    "The code you are using might need to be modified and you will need to go to each place where you have used it to perform the exact same modification.\n",
    "This is doable if you have the same code in two locations of your program, but what if you have copy-pasted it hundreds of times?\n",
    "\n",
    "An important concept in programming is *abstraction* and this is what we use as developers to solve the previously mentioned problem.\n",
    "According to Prabhakar Radge, abstraction can be defined as \"the process of finding similarities or common aspects, and forgetting unimportant differences.\"\n",
    "Abstraction is what allows us to create concepts like \"person\" from singular cases.\n",
    "We all know that every person on Earth is different from each other, but they have certain characteristics that allow us to classify them within the category \"person\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we can perform abstraction at different levels.\n",
    "When it comes to functionality, we identify certain patterns in the code or a sequence of instructions that perform the same or similar goal, and then we put them together in what we call a *function*.\n",
    "**Functions** then allow us to call a group\n",
    "of instructions over and over again, without copying and pasting. \n",
    "You can give them a meaningful name to remember what their purpose is (e.g. the `print` function).\n",
    "As you will see later, functions can also receive a set of inputs that can modify their behavior and/or output. \n",
    "Afterward, you will only need to call them in the parts of your program where you need such functionality.\n",
    "Contrary to the copy-paste strategy, if a change needs to be performed, you will usually have a single point in your program to modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will get to know how to call a function and some built-in functions that can help with your programming."

    "\n",
    "The functions presented in the previous section are built-in functions. Every Python implementation will provide these functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of providing predefined functions is via **modules** or **packages** (which are, by the way, another way of abstraction). Python offers a rich collection of modules and packages so that desired frequent functionality can be easily reused, by calling the desired function from the module or package.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **module** is usually a Python file (with the `.py` extension) that contains a set of related function definitions.\n",
    "Additionally, a **package** is organized as a group of modules.\n",

    "from module_name import function_name \n",
    "import function1_name, function2_name from module_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line makes a simple import of the module. To call functions of a module imported this way you need to write `module_name.function_name()`.\n",
    "The second line gives an alias to the module when its name is too long and writing the whole name every time you want to call a function impacts the readability of the code. In this case, you call functions as follows `alias.function_name()`.\n",
    "In the previous two cases, you specified the name of the module and the name of the function, separated by a dot (also known as a period). This format is called **dot notation**.\n",
    "The third and fourth statements import the functions directly, meaning that you do not need to use the name of the module first to access the functions, rather you can simply write `function_name()` or `function2_name()`. "

    "To call a function you just need to know its name and arguments.\n",
    "Additionally, consider how you are planning to handle the output (if any), and which are possible side effects of the function (e.g. raising an exception).\n",
    "Then, you only need to call the function in the following way `functiona_name(argument1, argument2,...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional abstraction can also come at a higher level when defining modules and packages.\n",
    "Modules and packages have their own functions.\n",
    "You can leverage that functionality by directly importing it into your code using any form of the `import` statement.\n",
    "Some common modules used to help you develop your programs include the `math` and `random` modules.\n",
