	abstract = {© 2017 ACM. There is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional classroom setting. This is especially true for topics covering computational tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to improve the effciency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using commonly-Available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benets (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility.},

	abstract = {© 2017 Holdgraf, Rieger, Micheli, Martin, Knight and Theunissen. Cognitive neuroscience has seen rapid growth in the size and complexity of data recorded from the human brain as well as in the computational tools available to analyze this data. This data explosion has resulted in an increased use of multivariate, model-based methods for asking neuroscience questions, allowing scientists to investigate multiple hypotheses with a single dataset, to use complex, time-varying stimuli, and to study the human brain under more naturalistic conditions. These tools come in the form of “Encoding” models, in which stimulus features are used to model brain activity, and “Decoding” models, in which neural features are used to generated a stimulus output. Here we review the current state of encoding and decoding models in cognitive electrophysiology and provide a practical guide toward conducting experiments and analyses in this emerging field. Our examples focus on using linear models in the study of human language and audition. We show how to calculate auditory receptive fields from natural sounds as well as how to decode neural recordings to predict speech. The paper aims to be a useful tutorial to these approaches, and a practical introduction to using machine learning and applied statistics to build models of neural activity. The data analytic approaches we discuss may also be applied to other sensory modalities, motor systems, and cognitive systems, and we cover some examples in these areas. In addition, a collection of Jupyter notebooks is publicly available as a complement to the material covered in this paper, providing code examples and tutorials for predictive modeling in python. The aimis to provide a practical understanding of predictivemodeling of human brain data and to propose best-practices in conducting these analyses.},

@book{Bruce2017,
	abstract = {Statistical methods are a key part of of data science, yet very few data scientists have any formal statistics training. Courses and books on basic statistics rarely cover the topic from a data science perspective. This practical guide explains how to apply various statistical methods to data science, tells you how to avoid their misuse, and gives you advice on what's important and what's not. Many data science resources incorporate statistical methods but lack a deeper statistical perspective. If you're familiar with the R programming language, and have some exposure to statistics, this quick reference bridges the gap in an accessible, readable format. With this book, you'll learn: Why exploratory data analysis is a key preliminary step in data science How random sampling can reduce bias and yield a higher quality dataset, even with big data How the principles of experimental design yield definitive answers to questions How to use...},

@book{Diez2010,
	abstract = {OpenIntro is a new project. Statistics is our first book. David Diez and Christopher Barr founded the OpenIntro project in 2009 to improve the quality and availability of education by producing introductory books and teaching tools that are free to use and easy to modify. Since our first conversations, the project has grown to include a group of core Fellows - Filipp Brunshteyn, Mine {\c C}etinkaya, Rob Gould and Meenal Patel - and countless other collaborators. Together, our team hopes to lead a growing movement in open source education. Our inaugural effort is OpenIntro: Statistics. First and foremost, OpenIntro: Statistics (Preliminary Edition) strives to be a complete introductory textbook of the highest caliber. Its core derives from the classic notions of statistics education, and is extended by recent innovations. This, our first release, includes chapters in foundations of probability and statistical inference, and also reflects the increasing interest in simulations and applied data analysis. The approach is immersive and practical. We are proud to make the book available in paperback for less than 7 dollars from amazon.com and free in PDF from our homepage openintro.org. Visit us often to track our progress and get involved. David M Diez is a postdoctoral fellow and Christopher D Barr is an assistant professor - both in the Department of Biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health. Mine {\c C}etinkaya is a graduating doctoral student in the Department of Statistics at UCLA.},
