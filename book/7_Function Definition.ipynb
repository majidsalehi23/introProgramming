    "Using functions defined by third parties might be useful especially when you want to focus on the development of your core functionality.\n",
    "For instance, if you need to compute the logarithm on base 10 of a number, it might be useful to use the `math` module, rather than implementing it from scratch.\n",
    "When relying on these external implementations, you do not need to reinvent the wheel.\n",
    "However, functions do not appear only on external modules or packages, or as part of the Python built-in functions.\n",
    "Sometimes, you might experience the need to use *your own code* in several parts of your program.\n",
    "In such cases, you are in charge of defining your own functions offering the features you need in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining your functions, you should give them a **meaningful name** and then follow computational thinking steps where you:\n",
    "- Identify the inputs or **parameters** of your function.\n",
    "- Decide on the output or **result** of your function.\n",
    "- Consider any **side effects** (e.g. printing, raising exceptions).\n",
    "- Implement the steps or **algorithm** to use the inputs to produce the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In parallel, don't forget to use **coding style conventions**, write **readable code**, and document your function with a proper **docstring** and **type hints** (for both your inputs and output).\n",
    "(You should also start considering your **test cases** but this topic won't be covered in this chapter.)\n",
    "In the end, the code is a way to *communicate not just with the computer but also with other people!*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will get to know how to define a function and its main components (e.g. parameters, return type, docstring, assumptions and assertions).\n",
    "We will also reflect upon the main computer science concepts behind the use and definition of functions (e.g. encapsulation, generalization)."

    "## 2. Function Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have only been using existing Python functions, but it is also possible\n",
    "to define our own functions. This gives us a very powerful tool when developing software.\n",
    "It allows us to structure our code by means of abstraction and hiding the internal computations on the body of a function.\n",
    "Additionally, recall that a function is a mechanism to facilitate reuse. \n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of programmers are lazy and use the principle of *copy-and-paste*. \n",
    "If they see a few lines of code that do the job, they copy and paste them, instead of creating a proper function. \n",
    "This behavior leads to *code clones* and code clones\n",
    "hamper maintenance in the long run. \n",
    "If it is one or few (the rule of thumb would be three) statements it is fine, but if you copy and paste more statements, please, extract that functionality and create a proper function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **function definition** specifies the name of a new function and the\n",
    "sequence of statements that run when the function is called.\n",
    "(You can have also function calls of your own functions.)\n",
    "In Python, it looks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(param1, param2, ...):\n",
    "    # function_body: instructions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we always start with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name (i.e. `function_name`).\n",
    "We then open parentheses `(` and we write down the sequence of **parameters** the function is expecting.\n",
    "This sequence can be *empty* but needs to be *finite*.\n",
    "Afterward, we close parentheses `)` and add a colon `:` to indicate that the function body is about to start.\n",
    "Using the right indentation, we write the **body** of the function, which is nothing more than the sequence of instructions that offer the functionality.\n",
    "By convention, indentation is always four spaces or a tab.\n",
    "Optionally, you can **return** a value if that is the intention of the function.\n",
    "We do not usually write the `...`. \n",
    "In this example, the symbol indicates that you can expect more parameters.\n",
    "Do not confuse it with the *ellipsis* symbol in Python (which serves different purposes depending on its use). \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge for a programmer is to identify which group of instructions is suited to transform into a function, which name should be givenn to the function, which parameters to include, and which value to return. \n",
    "Additionally, when you have written too many parameters, this might be an indication that you should split your functionality even more or better design your function (for instance, by expecting a list rather than independent values as a parameter).\n",
    "It is a matter of experience but also of continuously reflecting on your code\n",
    "and applying refactorings when you are not satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see a real example of a function definition."

    "In this chapter, we learned that functions are a way of encapsulating and generalizing functionality.\n",
    "We also discovered how to define our own functions by providing a meaningful function *name*, the inputs of the function also known as **parameters** (also with meaningful names), the output or **result** of the function (if any), the **algorithm** implementation, and additional elements such as the **docstring** and **type hints**, which are used as documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also identify the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**.\n",
    "In particular, a parameter is a variable that captures the value of a real expression passed as an argument to the function.\n",
    "Remember that parameters and **local variables** are available only within the **scope** of the function body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we got to know that functions that retrieve a value *must* have at least one `return` statement and alternative paths must be considered to place the statement(s) in the right location(s).\n",
    "Functions that have no `return` statement are known as **void functions**.\n",
    "Any function (including void functions) can produce **side effects** during execution.\n",
    "A side effect can be, for example, printing in the console or raising an exception.\n",
