# Lectures

## General Remarks
 - We must introduce more inline exercises, so students can practice a bit more. This is of especial importance when dealing with difficult topics.
 - First 2-3 weeks are very dense topic-wise.
 - Try to keep between 10-15 topics per notebook.
 - Comply with the Python coding standard.
 - Standardize all Introduction sections in all notebooks.
