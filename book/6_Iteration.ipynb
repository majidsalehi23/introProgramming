    "This notebook introduces the notion of a loop.\n",
    "In particular, we introduce the `while` statement together with the `break` and `continue` statements. Loops are together with assignments and conditionals the most important language constructs in most of the programming languages. They offer the possibility to repeat computations.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Computers are good in repeating boring tasks, they do this faster and more accurate than people. \n",
    "A block of code that is executed several times is called a **loop**.\n",
    "Each repetition of instructions within a loop is called an **iteration**. \n",
    "One of the loop statements we can use in Python is called the `while` loop.\n",
    "A `while` loop is defined as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while termination_condition:\n",
    "    # body\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You start with the **`while` keyword**, followed by a **termination condition**, followed by a **colon**.\n",
    "The next lines contain the body of the loop.\n",
    "The **body** of a loop is a sequence of Python statements (**one or more statements**) that are executed during every iteration of the loop. The body of the loop is the collection of indented statements after the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow of execution for a `while` statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine whether the **termination condition** is `True` or `False`.\n",
    "2. If `False`, **exit** the `while` statement and continue with the next statement outside of the loop.\n",
    "3. If the condition is `True`, **run the body** and go back to step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of flow is called a *loop* because the third step loops back to the top.\n",
    "Let us see an example."

    "This chapter provides a comprehensive guide to **while** loops and **for** loops in programming, covering fundamental concepts such as **loop syntax**, **termination conditions**, and **control statements** like `break` and `continue` within Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are tasked with finding the factorial of a non-negative number:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With a **while** loop, you can perform the multiplication iteratively. For instance, using `while number > 1`, you can multiply the `result` by the `number` and then decrease the `number` for the next iteration.\n",
    "- The **while** loop will be terminated if `number <= 1`, so the **termination condition** is when `number` becomes `1`.\n",
    "- In this example, a **for** loop can be used instead of the **while** loop. For instance, using `for i in range(1, number + 1)`, you can multiply the `result` by the `i`.\n",
    "- The **for** loop will be terminated if `i > number`, so the **termination condition** is when `i` becomes `number + 1`.\n",
    "- You can also use **control statements** to terminate a loop earlier when specific conditions are met (`break`), and/or to skip specific iterations within a loop in order to optimize processing workflow (`continue`). For instance, when you use `continue` if `number == 2`, your code would skip the rest of the current iteration when `number` is equal to `2`; and when you use `break` if `result > 10`, your code would exit the loop when the `result` exceeds `10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter emphasizes the importance of proper loop initialization and termination to equip you with the skills to efficiently manipulate data and control program flow."
