    "Humans communicate using natural languages such as English, Farsi, Mandarin, Turkish, Dutch, or Spanish.\n",
    "When it comes to communicating with a machine, computer scientists designed and developed a set of so-called programming languages. \n",
    "However, these artificial languages must support the representation of regular natural communication—as in the end, humans are aiming at solving human-related problems via computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we introduce a very useful and frequent data type, namely the string type.\n",
    "Strings have been created to represent natural language in its written form—that is, they are nothing more than regular text (as we often see it in books, newspapers, and chats with friends, among others).\n",
    "They are called strings as they can be seen as a sequence or \"string\" of characters.\n",
    "We have already seen some examples that include variables and values of such type, and probably, you already have an intuition on how to use it.\n",
    "Besides getting familiar with the notion of this data type, we will also explore some of the operations we can perform with it and some additional hands-on examples.\n",
    "Strings are also interesting because it allows us to apply the notion of *iteration*."

    "We have seen so far a number of basic data types: integers (`int`), floats (`float`), and Booleans (`bool`).\n",
    "However, we will need additional data types to describe and manipulate other type of data (like regular text written in natural languages). \n",
    "For instance, if we want to calculate the average of a list of integers, the basic data types that we have covered so far are not sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with the **string** type, which is a (non-basic) data type `str` in Python. \n",
    "A string represents a **sequence** of characters.\n",
    "You can consider a *sequence* as a group of *ordered* elements.\n",
    "In Python, strings are written surrounded by simple or double quotes.\n",
    "there is no functional difference between both representations.\n",
    "You can choose the style you prefer."

    "In this chapter, we have learned that string is a built-in *data type* used to represent natural language text.\n",
    "Particularly, text represented in such a way is called a string because it is a sequence (or \"string\") of characters.\n",
    "The type is written `str` in Python.\n",
    "We can either use *single or double quotes* to surround the text we want to represent as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that a string is, in the end, a sequence, we can access specific elements of the sequence by *indexing* the original string (we specify a number or *index* within the \"[]\" characters).\n",
    "We can also extract substrings from the original string by means of slicing it (we specify at least the starting end ending index from where we want to extract the *slice* or substring).\n",
    "We have also discovered that strings are *immutable**; \n",
    "that is, they cannot be modified, rather you need to create a new string from scratch with the required modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some Boolean operations you can perform with strings that are very handy when writing programs.\n",
    "Specifically, the `in` and comparison operators are of great help.\n",
    "Additionally, string values are really *objects* and objects expose a set of \"special functions\" called methods.\n",
    "You can use all string functions when dealing with a string, for example, the `upper` or `find` *methods*.\n",
    "Finally, strings are very useful when they can be formatted based on external values coming from other expressions or variables in your code. \n",
    "For that, we have different alternatives like the *format operator*, the *format method*, and *f-strings*.\n",
    "However, we recommend using the latter.\n",

    "Humans still need to communicate with each other via natural language, even if it is in textual form via a Jupyter notebook, website, mobile application, or any other sort of program."
