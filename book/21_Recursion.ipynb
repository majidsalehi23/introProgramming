    "Rózsa Péter, born Rózsa Politzer, (17 February 1905 – 16 February 1977) was a Hungarian mathematician and logician. She is best known as the \"founding mother of recursion theory\". \n",

    "In computer science, **recursion** is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion solves these recursive problems by using **functions that call themselves** from within their own code. Recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The power of recursion evidently lies in the possibility of defining an infinite set of objects by a finite statement. In the same manner, an infinite number of computations can be described by a finite recursive program, even if this program contains no explicit repetitions.\" A quote by Niklaus Wirth in his book *Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs*, 1976"
